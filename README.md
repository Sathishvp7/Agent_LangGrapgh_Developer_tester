# 🤖 Agentic AI Software Development System

An autonomous **Agentic AI system** that simulates a real-world software development lifecycle using multiple intelligent agents. The system includes a **Developer Agent**, **Tester Agent**, and an automated **Feedback Loop** that continuously improves the generated software until it meets quality standards.

This project demonstrates the core principles of **Agentic AI**, including autonomous decision-making, iterative improvement, and multi-agent collaboration.
